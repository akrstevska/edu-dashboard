# EduDashboard

EduDashboard is an intuitive and customizable web application designed to manage and visualize educational data. It features a dynamic dashboard with widgets that users can customize according to their preferences. These widgets allow you to control what information is displayed, adjust the layout, and choose the widget sizes. The dashboard offers insights into:

- **Number of students**
- **Courses available**
- **Students enrolled per course**
- **Upcoming enrollment deadlines**
- **Other relevant academic data**

The application utilizes a **Java Spring Boot backend** to handle data management, which is available in the [edu-dash-api](https://github.com/akrstevska/edu-dash-api) repository. The API is hosted on **Azure**, ensuring secure and reliable data retrieval.
